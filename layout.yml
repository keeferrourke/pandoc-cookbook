# This file *must not* begin with a document delimiter!

# A chapter currently consists of a name and a recipe list.
# It may be extended later to allow some forward text, but I have an
# agenda against recipes which are also novels :)

chapters:
 - name: Food
   recipes:
     - *african-peanut-stew
     - *okonomiyaki
 - name: Drinks
   recipes:
     # You might not want an hrule at the end of some recipes.
     # For example, the first short recipe of a chapter.
     # Disable the hrule by merging the recipe in with the nohrule field.
     - <<: *manhattan
       nohrule: true
     # Or just include the recipe and let the global template styling do its thing.
     - *toronto
     - *gin-and-tonic
     - *tom-collins
# This document terminator is required!
